# What Makes an Effective Programmer?

What do the best programmers do that the average programmers don't?

_Do they write more code faster?_

Can we say that because one person A wrote 10,000 lines and person B wrote 500
that A is outperforming B? No, we can't. In the world of software development
500 lines of code can do the work of 10,000 and it's much easier to work on the
500 lines than 10,000.

_Do they get code to pass tests more quickly?_

Sometimes! But since programmers write the tests as well as their implementation
code—the code that satisfies the tests—they can only test what they themselves
know about. An inexperienced programmer will write low-value tests that low-
value code can pass quickly, and sleep soundly not knowing how blind they were.
The measure of code is not passing already written tests, but creating the
potential to expand on the code's behavior in the future.

The difference is _process_.

Effective programmers take the time to _really_ understand the problem
they're trying to solve. Once they understand it, they make focused, decided
steps with _mindfulness_ to implement the solution. **Learning to program is the
art of solving problems.** It's the main muscle that you are constantly
developing.

Let's dive in a bit deeper here. What is problem solving?

## Problem Solving in the Abstract

Think about some of the problems people have on a regular basis. If you're a
soccer player, getting past the defense to score a goal is a problem, because
there are people blocking you from kicking the ball into the net. If you're
hungry, making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a problem, because you need
to find the ingredients and assemble them in the correct order. Whether we call
it a "play" on the soccer field or a "recipe" in the kitchen, essentially what
you're doing is following a process to create _another_ process &mdash; a
process that will solve the problem.

Good programmers do this every time they start on a new bit of work. From adding
a little updated feature to creating a brand-new project from scratch. Their
process typically looks like:

* What is the problem I'm trying to solve?
* What does the output look like? What is the end result I'm trying to build?
* What inputs do I need in order to create that output?
* What do I have now? What is missing?

### How Do We Develop the Problem-Solving Muscle?

You build the problem-solving skill the same you build every skill: constant,
_conscious_ effort and practice. The great thing about learning to program is
that you have constant access to problems that help build this skill. Every lab
and every real-world observation is an opportunity to practice and get better.
